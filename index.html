For snacks, they offer a variety of 'tapas', 'salmorejo' (a thick, cold tomato and garlic soup), cold meats, cured meat from Leon, duck ham and potato omelette, among other things. <br>Opinion: This is a great bodega in a busy and popular area of the city. It gets pretty crowded at night so I would recommend getting there early to secure a good seat. I heard that they are famous for their tortillas and they lived up to the expectation! Very fair pricing as well<br><br></div></div>

As luck would have it, Sacha is now the head chef and proprietor, helming a menu that has become a staple for Madrid foodies. The offerings here change seasonally, but the selection always has its foundation in traditional Spanish cuisine <br>Opinion: This is a top tier restaurant in Madrid. It is a very popular restaurant with the locals and there are not many tourists! They have a great wine list and every item on the menu has been carefully thought out. It is a
                    little hard to find, but I will be back next time I am in Madrid! <br><br> </p></div></div>
